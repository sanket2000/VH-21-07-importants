The Values Wall<br />
At Meeting Tomorrow we take our company core values seriously. We hire people who embody these<br />
ideals and a prominent Values Wall located near the front door of the office reminds us why we're here<br />
(for ourselves, each other, and our customers) every day.<br />
The Wall is an ever-evolving, collaborative effort. There's always paper, pens and thumbtacks available<br />
nearby so that anyone can add a note recognizing a peer for something specific they've done related to<br />
one of our three core values:<br />
Commitment, Kindness, Humility<br />
What do these words mean? Here are the literal definitions according to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary.<br />
Commitment: the attitude of someone who works very hard to do or support something<br />
Kindness: having or showing a gentle nature and a desire to help others; wanting and liking to do good<br />
things and to bring happiness to others<br />
Humility: the quality or state of not thinking you are better than other people<br />
Now, more importantly, what do these words mean to us? Here are some examples from our Wall.<br />
Commitment:<br />
Making everyone's lives a little bit easier<br />
Being an out of office contact for someone - You have to manage your own business & someone<br />
else's.<br />
• Eating all of the fridge purge garbage to minimize waste - what a guy!!<br />
Our after-hours team is committed to making sure our clients have everything they need - no<br />
matter the hour!<br />
Getting me up to speed as a trainee and having never-ending positivity<br />
The warehouse team stays late ALL THE TIME to ship out orders<br />
Even with a newborn baby keeping him up all night, staying late to put out fires and help out the<br />
team
Kindness:<br />
Co-workers who go above and beyond when you are out of the office<br />
Getting all returned equipment checked in, but never seeking affirmation or recognition for it<br />
Staying late to help me jump my car when my battery died<br />
• Stopping by each person's desk just to say how are you? (and meaning it!)<br />
Caring a great deal about her team and showing it every day<br />
Coming to work and finding a "have a wonderful day" card on my desk<br />
Humility:
